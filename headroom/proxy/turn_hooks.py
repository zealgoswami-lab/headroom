"""Turn hooks — observe and optionally re-drive a single model turn.

A *turn hook* wraps the proxy's buffered upstream call: it sees the outbound
request and the model's response, and may call the model again (via
``call_model``) to return a *replacement* response — transparently to the client.
That covers a range of turn-level behaviors an extension might want: resolving an
injected tool call, enforcing a guardrail, retrying on a bad response, serving a
cached answer, or running a small model→proxy→model loop before handing back the
final answer.

Hooks are registered by opt-in proxy extensions (``proxy/extensions.py``). This
module is **inert unless a hook is registered**: the runner helpers return their
input unchanged, so with no hooks the proxy behaves exactly as if this module did
not exist. Hooks must never raise — a failing hook is logged and skipped so it
cannot take the proxy down.

Stability: the ``TurnHook`` protocol and the registry/runner functions are part
of the extension surface (see ``proxy/extensions.py``); signature changes follow
the same deprecation policy.
