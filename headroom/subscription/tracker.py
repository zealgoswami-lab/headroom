"""Background subscription window tracker for Anthropic OAuth accounts.

Polls GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage on a configurable interval
while there has been at least one active OAuth session within the last minute.
Falls back to a stored token from ~/.claude/.credentials.json when no live
request has come through the proxy recently.

Architecture:
- Single asyncio.Task polling loop (started in start(), stopped via asyncio.Event)
- Thread-safe state updates via threading.Lock (consistent with headroom patterns)
- Atomic JSON persistence via tempfile + os.replace()
- Module-level singleton via get_subscription_tracker() / configure_subscription_tracker()

Also reads Claude transcript JSONL files (via session_tracking module) to provide
token breakdowns per window that enable:
  - Headroom efficiency metrics (tokens saved = raw - what proxy sent)
  - Surge pricing detection (API utilization vs expected from weighted tokens)
  - Cache miss detection (low cache_reads despite high input tokens)
