    """Mechanism B: hold-back Read maturation (compress before cache entry).

    Motivation (measured by `headroom audit-reads`): the median Read stays

    provider's cache-read rate every request — a Read's lifetime cost is
    roughly 13x its size. The only cache-safe moment to shrink it is
    BEFORE it is ever cache-written.

    Mechanics: a fresh large Read is held out of the provider prefix
    cache (the trailing cache breakpoint is relocated to just before it)
    while its file is ACTIVE, stays verbatim the whole time the model is
    working with it, and matures into a CCR-backed marker once the file
    has been quiet for `quiesce_turns`. Only that final compressed form
    ever enters the cache. No cached byte is ever mutated — there is
    nothing to bust.

    Activity-based (not a fixed hold window) because the audit-reads
    simulation showed touch gaps are fat-tailed: next-touch p50 is 4
    turns but p90 is 81 — no fixed window covers the tail, while a
    quiesce rule covers the activity cluster and lets the tail self-heal
    via the model's observed habit of re-reading ranges from disk (95%
