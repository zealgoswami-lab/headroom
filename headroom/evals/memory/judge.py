"""LLM-as-judge scoring for memory evaluation.

Uses an LLM to evaluate answer quality by comparing predictions
against ground truth answers. More nuanced than token-level metrics
like F1 and exact match.

The judge scores answers on a 1-5 scale:
- 5: Perfect match (semantically equivalent)
- 4: Mostly correct (minor details differ)
- 3: Partially correct (key info present, some errors)
- 2: Mostly incorrect (some relevant info, major errors)
- 1: Completely wrong (irrelevant or contradictory)

Given a question, the ground truth answer, and the system's predicted answer,
score the prediction on a scale of 1-5:

5 = Perfect: The predicted answer is semantically equivalent to the ground truth
4 = Mostly correct: The prediction captures the main point with minor differences
3 = Partially correct: The prediction has some correct information but is incomplete or has errors
2 = Mostly incorrect: The prediction has minimal relevant information or significant errors
1 = Completely wrong: The prediction is irrelevant or contradicts the ground truth

Question: {question}

Ground Truth Answer: {ground_truth}

Predicted Answer: {prediction}

First, provide a brief reasoning (1-2 sentences), then give your score.

Format your response EXACTLY as:
Reasoning: <your reasoning>
Score: <number 1-5>"""
