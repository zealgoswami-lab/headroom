"""Adaptive compression sizing via information saturation detection.

Instead of hardcoded max_items/max_matches, this module statistically determines
how many items to keep by finding the "knee point" — where adding more items
stops providing meaningful new information.

Algorithm: Track unique bigrams as items are added in importance order. Build a
cumulative coverage curve. Find the knee (Kneedle algorithm) where marginal
information gain drops sharply. That's the optimal K.

Per-tool profiles apply a bias multiplier on the statistically-determined K:
- conservative (bias=1.5): keep 50% more than mathematically needed
- moderate (bias=1.0): trust the statistics
- aggressive (bias=0.7): compress harder
