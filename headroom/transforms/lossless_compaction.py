"""Format-native, reversible lossless compaction for no-CCR proxy mode.

Every helper here is pure stdlib and keeps its output *looking like its own
type* — grep stays grep, logs stay logs, diffs stay diffs. No retrieval
marker (``<<ccr:…>>`` / ``Retrieve …``) is ever emitted, so the proxy needs
no MCP retrieve round-trip to stay recoverable.

The reversible transforms ship with exact inverses and are self-checked at
runtime by :func:`compact_lossless`: if a round-trip does not reproduce the
original (modulo intentionally-dropped non-semantic bits such as ANSI color)
or the result is not actually smaller, the original content is returned
unchanged. Nothing here raises.
