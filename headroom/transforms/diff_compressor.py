"""Git diff output compressor — Rust-backed via PyO3.

The Python implementation has been retired (Stage 3b, 2026-04-25). All
diff compression now goes through `headroom._core.DiffCompressor` (built
from `crates/headroom-py`). The byte-equality of the two implementations
was verified against 27 recorded fixtures before the Python source was
removed; the Rust crate has its own test coverage in `crates/headroom-core/`.

This module retains the public surface — `DiffCompressorConfig`,
`DiffCompressionResult`, `DiffCompressor` — so existing call sites
(ContentRouter, parity recorder, integrations, downstream users) keep
working unchanged. The dataclasses are still pure-Python because they
appear in dataclass-aware code paths (`asdict()`, `__dict__`, dataclass
matching). Only the `DiffCompressor` class delegates to Rust.

The `headroom._core` extension is a hard import: there is no Python
fallback. Build it locally with `scripts/build_rust_extension.sh`
(wraps `maturin develop`) or install a prebuilt wheel.
