"""Smart JSON array crusher — Rust-backed via PyO3.

The Python implementation has been retired (Stage 3c.1b, 2026-04-27).
All array compression now goes through `headroom._core.SmartCrusher`
(built from `crates/headroom-py`). Byte-equality of the two
implementations was verified against 17 recorded fixtures
(`tests/parity/fixtures/smart_crusher/`) before the Python source was
removed; the Rust crate has its own coverage in `crates/headroom-core/`
(388 unit tests + property tests).

This module retains the public surface — `SmartCrusherConfig`,
`CrushResult`, `SmartCrusher`, `smart_crush_tool_output` — so existing
call sites keep working unchanged. The dataclasses are still pure
Python because callers use `asdict()`, `__dict__`, and dataclass
matching on them. Only the `SmartCrusher` class delegates to Rust.

The `headroom._core` extension is a hard import: there is no Python
fallback. Build it locally with `scripts/build_rust_extension.sh`
(wraps `maturin develop`) or install a prebuilt wheel.

# Functionality state (post-audit, 2026-04-29)

- **TOIN learning** — re-attached. `crush()` and `_smart_crush_content`
  call `toin.record_compression()` after a real compression (filtered on
  `strategy != "passthrough"` to ignore JSON re-canonicalization).
  The retired Python class did this inline; the bridge keeps the
  highest-traffic strategy fueling the learning loop.
- **CCR marker emission** — honored end-to-end. Both
  `ccr_config.enabled=False` and
  `ccr_config.inject_retrieval_marker=False` flip the Rust crusher's
  `enable_ccr_marker` field; the lossy row-drop path then skips both
  the marker text and the CCR store write. Scope: gates only the
  row-drop sentinel path. Stage-3c.2 opaque-string CCR substitutions
  still emit always — they have no Python equivalent.
- **Custom relevance scorer / scorer override** — fails loud.
  `relevance_config` and `scorer` constructor args remain in the
  signature for source compat, but the shim raises
  `NotImplementedError` when either is non-None. Silently dropping a
  user-supplied scorer is a silent-fallback bug we explicitly refuse
  to ship; full plumbing lands with Stage-3c.2's relevance-crate
  Python bridge.

    #
    # Issue #389: SmartCrusher's row-drop and opaque-blob paths emit
    # `<<ccr:HASH ...>>` markers and stash the original payload in the
    # Rust process-local CCR store. /v1/retrieve queries the Python
    # `compression_store` via `get_compression_store()` — which is a
    # different store. Without an explicit bridge, every retrieve call
    # for a marker emitted by the Rust crusher returns 404.
    #
    # The bridge is straight Rust→Python mirror: extract every
    # `<<ccr:HASH>>` hash from the rendered output, fetch the canonical
    # bytes via `self._rust.ccr_get(hash)`, and call
    # `compression_store.store(..., explicit_hash=hash)` so the Python
    # store is keyed by the exact hash that's in the prompt marker.
    #
    # Best-effort by design: a missing compression_store import (e.g.
    # in a stripped CLI build) or a transient store error must NOT
    # break compression itself. Compression has already succeeded; the
    # bridge just makes /v1/retrieve work. Errors log at debug.
