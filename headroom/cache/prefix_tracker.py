"""Prefix Cache Tracker — session-scoped state for cache-aware compression.

Tracks provider prefix cache state between turns so the transform pipeline
can freeze already-cached messages and only compress new content.

Problem: Clients like Claude Code already manage prefix caching (up to 4
cache_control breakpoints, growing-prefix strategy). If Headroom compresses
or modifies messages in the cached prefix, it invalidates the cache —
replacing a 90% read discount (Anthropic) or 50% (OpenAI) with a 25%
write penalty.

Solution: After each API response, record how many tokens the provider
cached. On the next turn, freeze that many messages so the transform
pipeline skips them entirely.
