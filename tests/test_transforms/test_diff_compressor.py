"""Comprehensive tests for the public DiffCompressor API.

Tests cover:
1. Context line reduction
2. Hunk selection and limiting
3. Compression ratios
4. Edge cases
5. Bug-fix regressions and routing-gap fixtures

Stage 3b note (2026-04-25): the Python `DiffCompressor` implementation
was retired in favor of the Rust-backed shim (`headroom._core` via PyO3).
Tests that probed Python-only internals — `_parse_diff`, `_score_hunks`,
the `DiffHunk` / `DiffFile` parser dataclasses — were removed because
the Rust crate has its own parallel coverage in
`crates/headroom-core/tests`. Public-API tests (anything calling
`compressor.compress(...)`) are preserved unchanged: they exercise the
Rust backend through the same import path and assert the same outputs.
