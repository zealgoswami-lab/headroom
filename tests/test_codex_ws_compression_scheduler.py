"""P2 — Codex compression scheduler regression coverage.

The pre-fix code throttled all concurrent Codex WS compression units
through a process-global ``threading.BoundedSemaphore(10)`` and created
a fresh ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` per frame. Under realistic concurrent
load (≥10 sessions) the semaphore saturated, ``elapsed_ms`` was measured
INCLUDING the wait time, and frames hit the parent 30s timeout.

The fix:

* Deletes the module-global ``_CODEX_WS_UNIT_ROUTER_SEMAPHORE``.
* Deletes the per-call inner ``ThreadPoolExecutor``.
* Processes routed units serially inside the frame-level worker thread
  (``self._compression_executor`` already provides frame-level parallelism
  via the proxy-wide bounded executor).
* Adds a ``PERF`` log emission from ``handle_openai_responses_ws`` so
  Codex traffic is no longer invisible to ``headroom perf``.

These tests verify that future contributors cannot silently re-introduce
either bottleneck.

# "Success criteria":

    """Probe the 10-slot semaphore boundary with uniform-size workload.

    Design notes — addresses a CI-vs-dev hardware skew that bit the
    first iteration of this test:

    * **12 concurrent sessions** (> the deleted 10-slot semaphore size).
      Enough to saturate the gate if it ever reappears; small enough
      that a 2-vCPU CI runner doesn't drown in OS-level scheduler
      noise.
    * **All frames the same size (4 KB)** so size-induced compute
      variance cancels out. Pre-refactor the bug produced bimodal
      latency (waiters vs holders) regardless of frame size; this
      test must measure THAT, not size variance.
    * **5 frames per session** = 60 total. Enough samples to make
      the p99 statistic meaningful. Bounded runtime even on slow CI.
    * **Threshold ratio < 4×.** On uniform-size workload the only
      sources of p99/p50 spread are (a) the deleted semaphore tail
      (≈27×) or (b) OS-level scheduler noise (≈2–3×). 4× sits
      comfortably between the two — catches the bug, tolerates
      hardware. (First iteration tried 5× with mixed sizes, which
      let size-variance push CI ratios to 7.4×.) The ratio is only
      enforced once p99 clears a scheduler-noise floor — on very fast
      runners p50 rounds to 0ms and the ratio becomes pure jitter.
