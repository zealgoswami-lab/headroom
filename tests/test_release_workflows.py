    This is the load-bearing assertion for the entire build pipeline.
    If openssl-sys is in the wheel-build resolution graph, every
    Linux/macOS surface that builds from source needs system OpenSSL
    + perl modules + pkg-config — and we've spent five hot-fixes
    chasing whichever combination of perl modules / OpenSSL versions
    / pkg-config paths was missing in each manylinux/Dockerfile/
    devcontainer surface. The cleanest fix is to NOT depend on
    OpenSSL at all.

    fastembed exposes `hf-hub-rustls-tls` and
    `ort-download-binaries-rustls-tls` features that replace its
    default `native-tls` path. With `default-features = false` plus
    those rustls features enabled in headroom-core, our entire build
    tree uses rustls and no crate pulls openssl-sys.

    This test runs `cargo tree` (so it actually exercises the
    resolved feature graph, not just declared Cargo.toml features).
    A future refactor that adds a transitive native-tls user will
    fail here, surfaced at PR time rather than 5 minutes into a CI
    wheel-build error.
